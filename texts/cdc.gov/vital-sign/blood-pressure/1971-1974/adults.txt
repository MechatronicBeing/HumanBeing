The mean systolic blood pressure of civilian noninstitutionalized adults in the United States, as estimated from the Health and Nutrition Examination Survey findings in this cross-sectional study of 1971-1974, increases significantly and consistently with age from 119.0 mm. Hg in ages 18-24 years to 150.1 mm. Hg in ages 65-74 years (table 11). The increment is least among young adults 18-34 years (averaging 0.2 mm. Hg per year), then increases to and maintains a fairly steady rate of increase from 35 years on (an average of 0.8 mm. Hg per year). The rate of increase in systolic pressure is most rapid among children and youths (1.6 mm. Hg per year), then decreases to a minimal rate among young adults. 

For both men and women, mean systolic blood pressure increases significantly with age but from 25 years on, the rate is substantially faster among women than men (figure 8). The increase is at a minimum and similar for both men and women ages 18-34 years (an average increment of 0.2 mm. Hg per year). In ages 25-44 years and 45-64 years the average yearly increment is two to three times greater among women than men (an average annual increment of 0.7 mm. Hg for women compared wi,th 0.2 mm. Hg for men in ages 25-44 years and 1.1 mm. Hg for women compared with 0.4 mm. Hg for men
in ages 45-64 years).

Mean systolic pressure levels of males age 15-44 years are significantly higher than those for females, the differences reaching a maximum of nearly 9 mm. Hg in ages 18-24 and 25-34 years. In ages 45-54 years the mean systolic pressure of men is just slightly greater than that of women while from 55 years on the mean levels for women exceed significantly those for men by 4 to 6 mm. Hg.

The variability in systolic blood pressure levels of adults, as measured by the standard deviation, increases consistently with age from 13.8 mm. Hg among young adults 18-24 years to 25.2 mm. Hg among the oldest age group, 65-74 years. From 35 years on there is greater variability among women than among men in these pressure levels, though in ages 65-74 years the difference is negligible. In relation to the size of the mean systolic blood pressures, the relative variability in these levels among adults is less in ages 18-44 years (12-14 percent) than in ages 45 years and over (17 percent). Among men the relative variability is negligibly less (10-12 percent in ages 18-44 years and 15-17 percent in ages 45-74 years) than among women of a corresponding age (11-12 percent in ages 18-34 years and 16-18 percent in ages 35-74 years). The relative variability is just slightly greater among young adults 18-44 years than among children (11-12 percent) or youths (11-13 percent). 

At each of the selected percentile points in the distribution of systolic blood pressure among adults, there is a consistent increase with age from 18-24 years to 65-74 years and that increase becomes progressively greater across the distribution from 16.1 mm. Hg at the 5th percentile to 53.7 mm. Hg at the 95th percentile. Among men the increase is from a difference (youngest to oldest) of only 6.7 mm. Hg in systolic pressure levels for those at the 5th percentile to 45.7 mm. Hg at the 95th percentile, while for women the increase is from 22.4 mm. Hg at the 5th percentile to 66.3 mm. Hg at the 9 5th percentile (figures 9 and 10). 

Among all adults age 18-74 years the mean systolic pressure of men (131.4 mm. Hg) significantly exceeds that for women (128.4 mm. Hg) while the variability among men is less than among women, standard deviations of 19.2 mm. Hg and 24.0 mm. Hg, respectively. Mean diastolic blood pressure levels of U.S. adults increase with age, from 73.8 mm. Hg in ages 18-24 years to 86.7 mm. Hg in ages 55-64 years, then drop slightly. The average yearly increment is greater in ages 18-44 years (0.5 mm. Hg) than among those 45 years and over, in contrast to systolic pressure levels which increase more rapidly among older than younger adults.

Among men, mean diastolic pressures increase significantly with age, reaching a maximum in ages 45-54 years, .at a rate which declines from an average of 0.5 mm. Hg per year in ages 18-34 years to 0.3 mm. Hg per year in ages at 35-54 years. For women, mean diastolic blood pressures increase significantly with age from 18-64 years, at a rate that is fairly constant but slightly more rapid in ages 25-44 years than over the rest of the age range. In ages 18-54 years, mean diastolic blood pressures of men are significantly greater than those of women, while in ages 55-74 years the mean levels are similar.

The variability in diastolic blood pressure, as measured by the standard deviation, generally increases with age, but at a slower rate and less consistently than for systolic pressure. In relation to the size of the mean values, the relative variability is between 14 and 16 percent across the adult age range similar to findings for children and youths and shows no consistent age-related trend, in contrast to the increase in relative variability of systolic pressure with age among adults. The variability, relative and absolute, in diastolic blood pressures among men is slightly less than among women.

The difference in diastolic blood pressure between young adults age 18-24 years and the oIdest adults 65-74 years is greater at the upper than the lower percentiles in the distribution, ranging from 10 mm. Hg at the 5th through the 50th percentiles to nearly 20 mm. Hg at the 95th percentile. The increases with age, from youngest to oldest adults, are greater for women than for men, but for both are greater at the higher than the lower percentiles (figures 11 and
12).

As was noted for systolic blood pressure, the mean diastolic blood pressure of men age 18-74 years (83.4 mm. Hg) significantly exceeds that of women (79.7 mm. Hg) while the variability among men is slightly less (standard deviations of 12.3 mm. Hg for men and 13.3 mm. Hg for women).

The various percentile points in the distribution of systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels across the 6-74-year age range in the U.S. population, as shown in tables 1, 6, and 11, reflect the extent of the lack of symmetry in these distributions. The degree of conformity of these distributions of blood pressure levels in the population to the normal distribution was tested and the extent of skewness and kurtosis is shown in table 24. As may be seen, the
distribution of systolic and diastolic blood pressures for both men and women become increasingly skewed to the right and more peaked than normal through ages 45-54 years. For those 55 years and over, the skewness and peakedness in
the distributions of systolic and diastolic blood pressures lessen for both men and women.

As shown in tables 12-23 the bivariate distributions of systolic and diastolic blood pressures of adults reflect the greater variability, particularly in systolic pressure, among women than among men in ages 35-64 years. The proportion with substantially elevated pressures of at least 140 mm. Hg systolic or at least 90 mm. Hg diastolic increases with age for both sexes, but in ages 55-74 years the increase is substantially more rapid for women than men. Among males these proportions increased steadily and significantly from 8 percent in ages 12-17 years to 65 percent in ages 65-74 years, while among females the gradient is more rapid, increasing from 4 percent at 12-17 years to 74 percent at 65-74 years. Among youths and adults 18-54 years, the proportion with substantially elevated blood pressure of this degree is consistently greater among males than among females. Similarly, the proportion with both systolic and diastolic blood pressure substantially elevated (systolic pressure of at least 140 mm. Hg and diastolic of at least 90 mm. Hg) increases markedly with age. For men, the increase is from 4 percent in ages 18-24 years to 36 percent in ages 65-74 years, while among women the percentage increases from 2 to 36 percent in ages 55-64 years, then drops slightly. In ages 12-54 years the proportion of men with both systolic and diastolic pressure substantially elevated exceeds that for women.

Mean systolic blood pressure levels of the U.S. population are found to be inversely related to the size of the family income. As family income increases from less than $3,000 to $10,000 or more per year, the mean systolic blood pressure of the population age 7-74 years decreases from 131.7 mm. Hg to 122.0 mm. Hg (table 31).

Within each of the income groups, mean systolic pressure increases consistently with age from the youngest to the oldest age group, this increase being more rapid in the lowest and least rapid in the highest income level group. When adjustment is made for differences in age distribution within the income level classes, the mean, age-adjusted systolic pressure levels for the population age 7-74 years decrease consistently from 126.5 mm. Hg among those in families with less than $3,000 income per year to 123.3 mm. Hg for those with $10,000 or more annual income-a decrease less than that for the unadjusted mean values but also statistically significant.

Among both males and females 7-74 years of age, mean systolic blood pressure decreases with the increase in the size of the family income, the decrease being statistically significant among females (4.1 mm. Hg in the age-adjusted values from the lowest to the highest income level class) but not among males (2.5 mm. Hg). Within each income level the mean, age-adjusted, systolic pressure for males exceeds that for females, but only in the highest income group is the difference large enough to reflect more than sampling variability.

Mean diastolic blood pressure of the U.S. population age 7-74 years also decreases significantly with the increase in the size of the family income; however, the association is significant only among females. Across all income levels the mean, age-adjusted diastolic pressure of males exceeds that for females.

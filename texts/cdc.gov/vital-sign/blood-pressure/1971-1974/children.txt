Systolic blood pressure among U.S. children increases significantly with age from a mean of 95.6 mm. Hg at 6 years to a mean of 106.0 mm. Hg at 11 years, an increase of 10.4 mm. Hg with an average increment of 2.1 mm. Hg per year of age (table 1 and figure 1). Across the more reliable part of the age range, 7-l 1 years, the mean value increases more slowly from 99.9 mm. Hg to 106.0 mm. Hg, an average increment of 1.5 mm. Hg per year of age.

Boys and girls show a similar pattern of increase in systolic blood pressure with age, although the trend is somewhat less consistent, reflecting the greater sampling variability in these estimates than for all children. The yearly increment for boys age 6-11 of 2.0 mm. Hg is just slightly less than the 2.2-mm. Hg and increase for girls. At each year of age, except 7and 10 years, the mean systolic pressure for girls slightly exceeds that for boys, but differences are not large enough to be statistically significant. 

The variability in systolic blood pressure among children 6-11 years, as measured by the standard deviation, shows no consistent increase with age, although it is least at 6 years. However, the relative variability in relation to the size of the mean values (100 times the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean) remains consistently between 11 and 12 percent across the age range and is no greater among boys than girls. At each of the selected percentile points in the distribution of these systolic pressures there is a general pattern of increase with age for boys and girls from 6 or 7 to 11 years, but the increase with age at the lower percentiles is about the same as at the upper percentiles (table 1 and figure 2). 

For the entire 7-11-year age group, systolic blood pressure means for boys and girls are identical-103.3 mm. Hg-and the standard deviation just slightly greater among girls (12.3 mm. Hg) than among boys (12.0 mm. Hg). 

Mean diastolic blood pressure among children also increases significantly with age from 6 to 11 years, but at an annual increment only about half that of systolic pressure. The mean level increases from 61.0 mm. Hg at age 6 years to 66.6 mm. Hg at age 11 years, an average yearly increment of 1.1 mm. Hg. From ages 7 to 11 years the average annual increment is slightly less-O.9 mm. Hg. 

Boys 6-l 1 years show a slightly faster rate of increase in mean diastolic pressure (1.3 mm. Hg per year) than girls (1.0 mm. Hg per year). At each year of age from 7 through 11 years mean diastolic pressure for boys is slightly, but not significantly, greater than for girls, whereas at 6 years of age the reverse is evident. 

The variability in diastolic blood pressure levels of children, as measured by the standard deviation, is slightly less at 6 years of age than at 7-11 years, but shows no consistent trend with age from 7 through 11 years. The relative variability in relation to the mean values is slightly greater for diastolic than for systolic blood pressure of children, ranging from 14 to 16 percent (compared with 11 to 12 percent for systolic pressure) for boys and girls throughout this age span. As with systolic pressure, there is a general pattern of increase with age between 6
or 7 years and 11 years (figure 3).

For the entire 7-ll-year age group, the mean diastolic blood pressure of boys (65.1 mm. Hg) is slightly, but not significantly, higher than that for girls (64.3 mm. Hg), while the standard deviation in these levels among girls (10.0 mm. Hg) is negligibly greater than among boys (9.6 mm. Hg).

The bivariate distributions of systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels among boys and girls 7-11 years of age are generally similar, with 59 percent of boys and 55 percent of girls having systolic pressure of 90-119 mm. Hg and diastolic pressure 60-79 mm. Hg (tables 2 and 3). The proportion of children with substantially elevated blood pressure-systolic of at least 140 mm. Hg or diastolic of at least 90 mm. Hg-is less than 1 percent and is about the same among girls (0.9 percent) and boys (0.8 percent).

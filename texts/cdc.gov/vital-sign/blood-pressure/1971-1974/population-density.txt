Systolic blood pressure levels of the U.S. population age 7-74 years show an inverse relationship to population density. The regression line, fitted by weighted least squares to the age-adjusted, mean systolic blood pressure of those persons in the four population density groups, has a slope significantly different from zero (the horizontal), indicating that the systolic blood pressure levels of the population vary significantly with population density (table 37). As would be expected, this relationship of blood pressure to population density is consistent with the findings for income because of the higher per capita income in urban than in rural areas.

The mean, age-adjusted systolic blood pressure of those persons age 7-74 years living in rural areas is 125.6 mm. Hg, compared with 123.1 mm. Hg for those in the largest urban areas. The relationship of population density to systolic blood pressure is not limited to the older age groups, but is clearly evident across the age range from children 7-11 years, through adults 65-74 years (with one insignificant exception, persons age 55-64 years).

Among both males and females, mean, age-adjusted systolic blood pressure is significantly and inversely related to the population density of their area of residence.

The age-adjusted mean diastolic blood pressure of persons 7-74 years also generally increases with a decrease in population density of their place of residence. The mean, age-adjusted diastolic blood pressures are between 77.2 and 77.8 mm. Hg for those living in urban communities, compared with 78.6 mm. Hg for those in rural areas. The decrease is slower than that for systolic pressure and is not statistically significant for males.

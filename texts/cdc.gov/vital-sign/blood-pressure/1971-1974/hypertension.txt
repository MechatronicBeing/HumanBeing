Epidemiologic studies have established that elevated systemic arterial blood pressure increases the risk of coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular accident. Recent studies by the Veterans Administration have clearly demonstrated that this risk is reduced by lowering blood pressure. 

Prevalence estimates of the extent and distribution of hypertension in the U.S. population as determined from the single blood pressure obtained in this study are shown in tables 40-42. 

For these the following criteria for adults were used: 
- Definite hypertension : either systolic pressure of 160 mm. Hg or more or diastolic pressure of 95 mm. Hg or more. (A subgroup of those with diastolic pressure of 105 mm. Hg or more is shown separately.) 
- Borderline hypertension ; systolic pressure below 160 mm. Hg and diastolic pressure below 95 mm. Hg, but not both below 140 mm. Hg systolic and 90 mm. Hg diastolic. 
- Normotension : both systolic pressure below 140 mm. Hg and diastolic pressure below 90 mm. Hg. 

Definite hypertension. 
In the United States there are an estimated 23.4 million or 15.2 per 100 persons age 12-74 years and 23.2 million or 18.1 per 100 persons age 18-74 years with definite hypertension, based on findings from the Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of 1971-1974. The prevalence rate increases rapidly with age from 0.8 per 100 persons at 12-17 years to 40.7 per 100 at 65-74 years (table 40). The average increment in this prevalence rate with age is slowest among youths and young adults (0.3 and 0.4 percent per year) and most rapid among persons 25-64 years of age (an average of 0.9 percent per year); then among older persons the rate of increase drops slightly (0.8 percent per year).
Definite hypertension is slightly more prevalent among men 18-74 years (19.2 per 100) than among women (17.1 per 100). The prevalence rates increase more rapidly with age among men than among women through 54 years of age, then the pattern reverses. In ages 18-34 years, definite hypertension is more than twice as prevalent among men; then in ages 35-54 years, while the difference decreases, the rates among men remain significantly higher than those among women. Finally, among persons 65-74 years the prevalence of definite hypertension becomes significantly higher among women (43.9 percent) than among men (36.6 percent). 

Borderline hypertension.
In addition to the 23.4 million youths and adults with definite hypertension, there are 24.8 million persons age 12-74 years in the United States with borderline hypertension (as defined here), a rate of 16.2 per 100 (table 42). Prevalence rates increase consistently with age more slowly than for definite hypertension, from 5.6 per 100 youths age 12-17 years to 29.8 per 100 adults 65-74 years. These figures show a five-fold increase in prevalence compared with a fifty-fold increment for definite hypertension. Among persons under 35 years of age the prevalence of borderline hypertension is more than twice that for definite hypertension; in ages 35-54 years the rates are essentially equal; while in ages 55-74 years the rate drops to about three-fourths of the rate for definite hypertension.
Except in the oldest age groups, 55-74 years, where the rates for men and women are similar, the prevalence rates for borderline hypertension among males exceed that among females. As was the case with definite hypertension, the increase in the prevalence of this borderline condition with age, from 12 to 74 years, is about twice as rapid for women as for men, but for both sexes the increase with age is substantially less than that shown in definite hypertension. 


Medical history.
Information was obtained in the medical histories preceding the examination on whether the examinees had ever been told by a doctor that they had hypertension, how many years they had such a condition (if previously diagnosed), and whether during the previous 6 months they had used medication for high blood pressure, and, if so, how frequently. The association of this information with the blood pressure findings of definite and borderline hypertension (as defined in this report) among the U.S. adult population is shown in table A.
Among those 23.2 million U.S. adults 18-74 years with definite hypertension, as determined from the blood pressure levels at examination, more than half (54.9 percent or 12.7 million) had never been diagnosed by a doctor as having hypertension, one-third (33.2 percent) had been so diagnosed and knew they still had the condition, while for the remainder this condition had been previously diagnosed, but either they thought they no longer had it (8.0 percent) or did not know if they still had it (3.9 percent).
The proportion of those with definite hypertension whose condition was previously undiagnosed is higher among younger than among older adults, the percent generally decreasing with age from 68.5 percent of persons age 18-24 years to 48.5 percent of persons 65-74 years (table 43). However, because the prevalence of definite hypertension, as determined from blood pressure levels in this examination survey, increases substantially with age, the population estimates of those with undiagnosed hypertension increase from about 0.5 million in ages 18-24 years to a maximum of nearly 3.5 million in ages 45-54 years, then drops to 2.5 million at 65-74 years. 
The decrease with age in the proportion of cases of undiagnosed hypertension (among those with definite hypertension) is more rapid and more statistically significant among women than among men. Men age 18-74 years are more likely than women to have such an undiagnosed condition (62.9 percent for men and 46.7 percent for women), the differences being largest and statistically significant among older adults 55-74 years. 
Those adults with definite hypertension whose diastolic blood pressure was 105 mm. Hg or greater at the time of the examination were less likely than the remainder with definite hypertension to have a condition that was not previously diagnosed (44.0 percent of those with elevated diastolic pressure of at least 105 mm. Hg compared with 58.8 percent of the remainder) and more likely to have the previously diagnosed condition still present (44.2 percent compared with 29.2 percent for the remainder with definite hypertension) as shown in tables 43, 44, and A. In this group with substantially elevated diastolic pressure as well as the remainder of those with definite hypertension, the proportion whose condition had not been previously diagnosed was significantly greater among men than women.
As might be expected, the proportion with no previous diagnosis of high blood pressure among those adults with borderline hypertension at the time of this survey (76.1 percent) was substantially greater than the corresponding proportion among adults with definite hypertension (54.9 percent), while the portion with a previously diagnosed condition of high blood pressure (14.6 percent of the borderline group) was less than half that among those adults with definite hypertension (33.2 percent). The proportion of those with borderline hypertension who were never diagnosed as having high blood pressure decreases with age from 87.3 percent among the 18-24-year-olds to 60.5 percent among those 65-74 years of age, and as for the undiagnosed group with definite hypertension, is significantIy greater among men (81.8 percent) than among women (69.3 percent). 
Nearly all (92.6 percent of the 81.4 million adults classified as normotensive on the basis of examination survey findings have never been diagnosed by a doctor as having high blood pressure. Those whose condition has been so diagnosed may be expected to include persons whose blood pressure is adequately controlled by medication, those whose condition has changed or was different at the time of the initial diagnosis than at the time of the survey, and those whose own doctor had used a different criterion for diagnosis than that used in the survey.
More than half the adults previously diagnosed as having high blood pressure had known this for 5 years or less, the proportion being 52.8 percent of those with definite hypertension, 59.2 percent of the borderline group, and 61.6 percent of the normotensives.
The question regarding the use of medication (medicine, pills or drugs) for high blood pressure in the past 6 months was asked each examinee irrespective of whether the condition had been previously diagnosed. The proportion taking such medication regularly is directly related to the severity of their hypertensive condition; 21.1 percent of those with definite hypertension took medication, compared with 8.9 percent of those with borderline hypertension and 2.0 percent of the normotensive group. Those with diastolic pressure of 105 mm. Hg or greater are more. likely than the other definite hypertensives to have taken medication for this condition (23.8 percent compared with 21.1 percent). Similarly, the proportion taking such medication occasionally decreases from 3.6 percent among those classed as definite hypertensive to 1.3 percent among the borderline group and to 0.3 percent among those with normal blood pressure.
If it can be assumed that those adults classed as borderline hypertensive or normotensive but taking medication regularly for high blood pressure are keeping their blood pressure below the level for definite hypertension by use of this medication, there would be an estimated 26.9 million adults in the United States, a rate of 21.0 per 100, with definite hypertension-the 18.1 per 100 whose blood pressure is still elevated to that degree and the 2.9 per 100 with blood pressure presumably controlled below that level by medication.

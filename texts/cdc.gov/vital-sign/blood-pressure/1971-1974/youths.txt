Among youths, mean systolic blood pressure increases from 109.3 mm. Hg at 12 years of age to 116.3 mm. Hg at 17 years, a total increase of 7.0 mm. Hg or an average yearly increment of 1.4 mm. Hg (table 6 and figure 1). This rate of increase is similar to that for children from 7 to 11 years. With the slight acceleration in systolic pressure from ages 10 to 14 years, the average annual increment over the entire 7-17-year timespan is slightly more rapid-l.6 mm. Hg per year.

Boys but not girls in the youth age range show a consistent increase with age in mean systolic blood pressure in contrast to the findings among children. From 12 to 17 years, the mean levels for boys increase steadily from 108.9 mm. Hg to 119.5 mm. Hg, an average increment of 2.1 mm. Hg per year, while for girls the increase is slight and inconsistent over the age range, from the mean of 109.7 mm. Hg at 12 years to 112.2 mm. Hg at 17 years, an average increment of only 0.5 mm. Hg per year. The mean systolic blood pressure of boys and girls ages 6-14 years are similar, showing only small differences not consistently in the same direction probabIy due to sampling variability alone. However, from 15-17 years the mean levels for boys consistently exceed those for girls by magnitudes which are statistically significant and increase with age from 4.7 mm. Hg at 15 years to 7.3 mm. Hg at 17 years

The variability m systolic blood pressure among youths, as measured by the standard deviation, is slightly greater than among children and does increase, though negligibly, with age from 15 to 17 years for both boys and girls. However, the relative variability in relation to the mean shows no age-related pattern and is at about the same level among youths (11-13 percent) as among children (11-12 percent). At each of the selected percentile points in the distribution of systolic blood pressures among boys, but not girls, there is a general and significant increase in pressure with age from 12 to 17 years, reflecting the greater proportion of boys than girls by this age with substantially elevated blood pressure. This increase in pressure levels from 12 to 17 ,years for boys is more than twice as great at the upper extreme of the distribution-the 90th and 95th percentiles (19.8and 21.8 mm. Hg, respectively) than across the remainder of the distribution where the differences between the levels at 12 years and 17 years range from 6.7 mm. Hg at the 10th to 9.6 mm. Hg at the 25th percentiles. The age-related trend for girls in systolic pressure is less consistent and the increases between 12 and 17 years of age are 2.0 mm. Hg or less at all percentile points, except at the 95th where the increment is 4.0 mm. Hg. 

For the entire 12-17-year age range, the mean systolic blood pressure of boys (114.9 mm. Hg) is significantly higher than that for girls (111.9 mm. Hg) because of the differences at ages 15-17 years, and the variability is just slightly greater among boys than girls (standard deviations of 13.8 and 13.4 mm. Hg).

The mean diastolic blood pressure of youths increases significantly with age from 67.4 mm. Hg at age 12 years to 72.6 mm. Hg at 17 years, an increment of 1.0 mm. Hg per year, which is nearly identical to that noted for children from 6 to 11 years of age. Hence, over the entire 6-17-year range the average yearly increment remains about 1.0 mm. Hg. The mean diastolic pressures of boys and girls are similar at 6-14 years, while from 15-17 years the levels of boys are consistently higher.

The variability in diastolic blood pressure levels, as measured by the standard deviation, is slightly less at 12 than at 17 years but shows no trend consistent with age for either boys or girls, a finding similar to that for diastolic pressure among children. In relation to the size of the mean values, the relative variability of the diastolic pressure shows no age-related pattern and is at about the same level among youths (13-15 percent) as among children (14-16 percent). Among both children and youths the relative variability in diastolic pressure is slightly greater than in systolic pressure (11-13 percent).

For all youths, the mean diastolic pressure of boys (70.5 mm. Hg) is significantly higher than that of girls (69.0 mm. Hg), while the standard deviation among boys (10.0 mm. Hg) is only negligibly larger than that among girls (9.7 mm. Hg).

In the bivariate distributions for the two blood pressure measurements among U.S. youths 12-17 years of age, nearly two-thirds of the boys (67 percent) and girls (65 percent) have systolic pressures of loo-129 mm. Hg and diastolic pressures of 60-89 mm. Hg (tables 7 and 8). The proportion of youths in this age range with substantially elevated blood pressure-systolic pressure of at least 140 mm. Hg or diastolic of at least 90 mm. Hg-is nearly twice as great among boys (8 percent) as among girls (4 percent) of this age. Similarly, the proportion with substantial elevations of both systolic and diastolic pressures-systolic pressure of at least 140 mm. Hg and diastolic pressure of at least 90 mm. Hg-is about twice as large among boys (1.3 percent) as among girls (0.7 percent).

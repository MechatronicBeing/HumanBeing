The two measures of educational attainment used in this report are those which most closely affect the socioeconomic status of the family: the educational level of the head of the household, for children and youths age 7-17 years, and the educational level of the examinee for adults.

On either basis, blood pressure shows a significant inverse relationship to educational level (similar to that with size of family income), the mean blood pressure decreasing with the increase in educational attainment.

Among children and youths age 7-17 years, mean systolic pressure decreases significantly with increase in educational level of the head of the household from 109.9 mm. Hg for those in families where the head of the household had completed less than 5 years of formal schooling to 107.3 mm. Hg among those with some college education (table 34). Similarly, among adults 18-74 years of age, mean, age-adjusted systolic pressure decreases significantly and consistently from 136.9 mm. Hg for those with less than 5 years schooling to 129.1 mm. Hg for those with some college education.

For boys and for girls, the relationship between systolic pressure and education of head of the household is nonsignificant. However, among both men and women the inverse relationship is consistent and significant. The mean, age-adjusted systolic pressure among men in the highest education level is 9.4 mm. Hg less and for women 8.3 mm. Hg less than among those in the respective lowest educational levels.

Diastolic blood pressure levels for children and youths of both sexes are unrelated to the educational levels of the head of the households. In contrast, among adults 18-74 years there is a significant relationship between education and diastolic blood pressure. The mean, age-adjusted diastolic blood pressure of persons at the highest educational level is lower than that of persons at the lowest educational level, the difference being 5.5 mm. Hg for men and 4.4 mm. Hg for women.

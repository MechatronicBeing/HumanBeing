In the sample design used for this survey, the United States was divided into four broad geographic regions-the Northeast, Midwest, South, and West-approximately equal in population, as described in appendixes I and II. The sample size and design of the survey do not provide an adequate basis for estimating blood pressure levels of the population in smaller geographic areas or in the individual States.

Across the 7-74-year age span, the mean systolic blood pressures of persons living in the South are higher than those of persons in the other three regions (table 28). When adjustments are made for differences in age distribution among the populations in the four regions, the age-adjusted mean systolic blood pressure level of persons in the South is significantly higher than that of persons in the Northeast (3.9 mm. Hg higher) or the West (4.3 mm. Hg higher) and slightly higher (2.3 mm. Hg) than for those in the Midwest. The mean systolic pressure levels are similar among persons living in the other three regions. The variation in systolic blood pressure levels among the populations in the South and Northeast is slightly greater than the variation among those in the Midwest and West.

Among males, there are no significant regional differences in mean systolic blood pressure levels. The age-adjusted values range from 127.2 mm. Hg for those in the South to 124.1 mm. Hg for those in the Northeast. However, among females age 7-74 years the mean, age-adjusted systolic pressure for those in the South (127.0 mm. Hg) is significantly higher than for those in the Midwest (123.2 mm. Hg), the Northeast (122.0 mm. Hg), and the West (121.3 mm. Hg). In each of these regions, the age-adjusted mean systolic pressure levels of men slightly exceed those of women, except in the South where essentially no difference exists.

Diastolic blood pressure levels of the population in each of the four regions are similar. The mean, age-adjusted values range from 78.5 mm. Hg and 78.4 mm. Hg in the South and Midwest, respectively, to 77.2 mm. Hg in the Northeast and West, while the variability as measured by the standard deviation in these measurements ranges from 14.1 mm. Hg in the South to 13.4 mm. Hg in the Midwest. In each of the regions the mean, age-adjusted diastolic blood pressure levels of males exceed those of females, and, except in the South these differences are too large to be due solely to sampling variability. 

Because of the scheduling of the examination locations in the present survey-the North was avoided during the winter as was the South during the summer-the effect of any seasonal or climatic fluctuations on blood pressure levels may have been either masked or accentuated in these regional findings. 


The 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia (excluding Alaska and Hawaii) were stratified into four broad geographic regions, each of about the same population size. With a few exceptions the compositions of the regions were as follows:
- Northeast : Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania
- Midwest : Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, IIlinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri
- South : Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Arkansas, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, District of CoIumbia
- West : Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota
In a few instances the actual boundaries of the regions did not follow State lines. Some strata in the Midwest and South include PSU’s actually located in the West. Similarly, some strata in the West contain PSU’s located in the
Midwest and South.
